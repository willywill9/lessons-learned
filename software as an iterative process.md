I think one of the biggest takeaways I got from the class is that software often is and should be an iterative process both in terms of development and implementation. 

It was interesting to understand how much customer discovery should be done before the development process begins but of course it makes sense given that as with all consumer products, a provider must understand their customer's motivation and needs. 

Iteration also continues once a general idea is formed and it's time to scope the project. Rather than trying to hold a development team to a specific cost amount or providing exact specs, the team is better off giving general directions and allowing the development to work through the best process for achieving the overall objectives. 

The importance of prototyping and testing also speaks to the need for iteration. I learned that software should be built in "stories", individual tasks which can be tested and optimized in parallel paths. This allows the dev team to receive user feedback on each tool and make adjustments throughout the dev process. By allowing the team to iterate constantly, the software will more likely be a stronger, more user friendly tool than if the entire thing is built and then adjusted. 

One of the biggest takeaways I got from the class is that software is rarely ever "done", but rather teams should except to make updates and fix issues during the course of the softwares use life. Therefore, it's important that a client or company set up appropriate development team resources ahead of time to anticipate those needs. 

Given this thought and my past life doing advertising for Dos Equis, I felt this picture was an appropriate mantra to keep in mind!
