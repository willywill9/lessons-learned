A key takeaway from this course is the fact that Agile is most often incorrectly implemented. For example, scrums should be short 7 min. meetings that cover what a development team did yesterday, what they plan to do today, and any roadblocks that have come up. Equally important, is the fact that an inventory of development items or enhancements to existing functionality can be kept, but it should not be TOO large of a list. You should have just enough that whenever a developer is done with his/her object or enhancement, they have a list of something else to work on. But, the backlog should not be too long because there will just be a ton of requests/requirements that are idle and not being worked on. This would indicate there are tons of things the business team needs and that the development team cannot deliver in a timely fashion.

@sjoseph15 please help provide feedback.
