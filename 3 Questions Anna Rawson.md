As an aspiring entrepreneur my biggest takeaway form the Digital Literacy class was information in relation to hiring and finding a programmer.
I thought Peter Bell did a fantastic job of articulating what programmers are like and how they think – which is very helpful when managing/hiring them.

The best place to find programmers:

•	Conferences

•	Meetups

•	Geek hang outs ☺

3 questions to ask when hiring a programmer:

•	What version, control system, framework and unit testing tool do you use?

•	What did you compare it to?

•	Why did you pick one over the other?

These questions are important because:

•	You want to make sure they keep track of changes in software

•	Make sure they are using RAILS etc not their own framework

•	Make sure computer uses system to check mistakes
